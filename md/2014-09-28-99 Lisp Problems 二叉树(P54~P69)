P54A (*) Check whether a given term represents a binary tree
Write a predicate istree which returns true if and only if its argument is a list representing a binary tree.

Example:

(istree (a (b nil nil) nil))

T

(istree (a (b nil nil)))

NIL


    (define (istree tree)
        (if (or (eq? 'nil tree) (null? tree)) #t ;empty is a tree

                      [left (istree (cadr tree))]
                      [right (istree (caddr tree))])

P55 (**) Construct completely balanced binary trees
In a completely balanced binary tree, the following property holds for every node: 
The number of nodes in its left subtree and the number of nodes in its right subtree are almost equal, 
which means their difference is not greater than one.

Write a function cbal-tree to construct completely balanced binary trees for a given number of nodes. 
The predicate should generate all solutions via backtracking. Put the letter 'x' as information into all 
nodes of the tree.
Example:

cbal-tree(4,T).

T = t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, nil, t(x, nil, nil))) ;

T = t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, t(x, nil, nil), nil)) ;

etc......No

构造完全平衡二叉树,完全平衡二叉树的定义是左右子树的节点数量相差不超过1。

算法执行步骤:

构造节点数量为(n - 1)/2的完全平衡树集合s1

构造节点数量为n - (n - 1)/2的完全平衡树集合s2

从s1中取元素作为左子树,从s2中取元素作为右子树.

如果s1 != s2

从s2中取元素作为左子树,从s1中取元素作为右子树.

        (iter n '()))	
        
        
P56 (**) Symmetric binary trees
Let us call a binary tree symmetric if you can draw a vertical line through the root 
node and then the right subtree is the mirror image of the left subtree. Write a predicate 
symmetric/1 to check whether a given binary tree is symmetric. Hint: Write a predicate mirror/2 
first to check whether one tree is the mirror image of another. We are only interested in the 
structure, not in the contents of the nodes.        

    (define (sametree? tree1 tree2)
        (cond [(or (and (pair? tree1) (not (pair? tree2)))
                   (and (pair? tree2) (not (pair? tree1)))) #f]
              [(and (eq? 'nil tree1) (eq? 'nil tree2)) #t]     
              [else (and (sametree? (cadr tree1) (cadr tree2)) (sametree? (caddr tree1) (caddr tree2)))]))

    (define (mirror? tree1 tree2);tree1的左子树结构==tree2的右子树且tree1的右子树结构==tree2的左子树则两树是镜像
        (and (sametree? (cadr tree1) (caddr tree2)) (sametree? (caddr tree1) (cadr tree2))))			

    (define (symmetric tree) (mirror? (cadr tree) (caddr tree)))
    
P57 (**) Binary search trees (dictionaries)
Use the predicate add/3, developed in chapter 4 of the course, 
to write a predicate to construct a binary search tree from a list of integer numbers.

Example:

construct([3,2,5,7,1],T).

T = t(3, t(2, t(1, nil, nil), nil), t(5, nil, t(7, nil, nil)))

Then use this predicate to test the solution of the problem P56.

Example:

test-symmetric([5,3,18,1,4,12,21]).

Yes

test-symmetric([3,2,5,7,1]).

No 


    (define (construct xs)
        (define (add x tree)
            (if (or (null? tree) (eq? 'nil tree)) (list x 'nil 'nil)
                (if (> x (car tree)) (list (car tree) (cadr tree) (add x (caddr tree)))
                    (list (car tree) (add x (cadr tree)) (caddr tree)))))	
        (define (iter xs tree)
            (if (null? xs) tree
                (iter (cdr xs) (add (car xs) tree))))
        (iter xs '()))
        
P58 (**) Generate-and-test paradigm
Apply the generate-and-test paradigm to construct all symmetric, 
completely balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes. Example:

sym-cbal-trees(5,Ts).

Ts = [t(x, t(x, nil, t(x, nil, nil)), t(x, t(x, nil, nil), nil)), t(x, t(x, t(x, nil, nil), nil), t(x, nil, t(x, nil, nil)))] 

How many such trees are there with 57 nodes? Investigate about how many solutions there are for a given number of nodes? 
What if the number is even? Write an appropriate predicate.        



    (define (sym-cbal-trees n)
        (let ([trees (cbal-tree n)])
             (foldr (lambda (x acc) (if (symmetric x) (cons x acc) acc))
                    '() trees)))
                    
                    
P59 (**) Construct height-balanced binary trees
In a height-balanced binary tree, the following property holds for every node: 
The height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree are almost equal,
 which means their difference is not greater than one.

Write a predicate hbal-tree/2 to construct height-balanced binary trees for a given height.
The predicate should generate all solutions via backtracking. Put the letter 'x' as information 
into all nodes of the tree.

Example:

hbal-tree(3,T).

T = t(x, t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, nil, nil)), t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, nil, nil))) ;

T = t(x, t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, nil, nil)), t(x, t(x, nil, nil), nil)) ;

P60 (**) Construct height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes
Consider a height-balanced binary tree of height H. What is the maximum number of nodes it can contain?
Clearly, MaxN = 2**H - 1. However, what is the minimum number MinN? This question is more difficult. 
Try to find a recursive statement and turn it into a predicate minNodes/2 defined as follwos:

% minNodes(H,N) :- N is the minimum number of nodes in a height-balanced binary tree of height H.
(integer,integer), (+,?)

On the other hand, we might ask: what is the maximum height H a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes can have?

% maxHeight(N,H) :- H is the maximum height of a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes
(integer,integer), (+,?)

Now, we can attack the main problem: construct all the height-balanced binary trees with a given nuber of nodes.

% hbal-tree-nodes(N,T) :- T is a height-balanced binary tree with N nodes.

Find out how many height-balanced trees exist for N = 15.

P63 (**) Construct a complete binary tree
A complete binary tree with height H is defined as follows: The levels 1,2,3,...,H-1 contain the maximum number of nodes 
(i.e 2**(i-1) at the level i, note that we start counting the levels from 1 at the root). 
In level H, which may contain less than the maximum possible number of nodes, all the nodes are "left-adjusted". 
This means that in a levelorder tree traversal all internal nodes come first, the leaves come second, and empty successors 
(the nil's which are not really nodes!) come last.

Particularly, complete binary trees are used as data structures (or addressing schemes) for heaps.

We can assign an address number to each node in a complete binary tree by enumerating the nodes in levelorder,
 starting at the root with number 1. In doing so, we realize that for every node X with address A the following property holds: 
The address of X's left and right successors are 2*A and 2*A+1, respectively, supposed the successors do exist. 
This fact can be used to elegantly construct a complete binary tree structure. Write a predicate complete-binary-tree/2 with the following specification: 

% complete-binary-tree(N,T) :- T is a complete binary tree with N nodes. (+,?)

Test your predicate in an appropriate way.	


    (define (height tree)

P65 (**) Layout a binary tree (2)
An alternative layout method is depicted in the illustration opposite. Find out the rules and write the corresponding Prolog predicate.
 Hint: On a given level, the horizontal distance between neighboring nodes is constant.

Use the same conventions as in problem P64 and test your predicate in an appropriate way.

P66 (***) Layout a binary tree (3)
Yet another layout strategy is shown in the illustration opposite. The method yields a very compact layout while 
maintaining a certain symmetry in every node. Find out the rules and write the corresponding Prolog predicate. 
Hint: Consider the horizontal distance between a node and its successor nodes. How tight can you pack together 
two subtrees to construct the combined binary tree?

Use the same conventions as in problem P64 and P65 and test your predicate in an appropriate way. 
Note: This is a difficult problem. Don't give up too early!
