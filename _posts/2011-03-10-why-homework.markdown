The Discovery Channel spends an entire week every year convincing us how incredibly awesome sharks are.  How do they do it?  Do they take a mako shark out of the ocean, squeeze it into a suit, and ask it questions about being a shark?  Not hardly.  They let us watch the thing cruising through the open ocean, chasing tuna and scaring the hell out of everyone.

When you apply to OPOWER, we want to see how awesome YOU are in your natural habitat.  Our homework helps us do that -- by giving you a project that you can complete on your own schedule, in your own environment.  Maybe you're a "early-morning coffee and Eclipse" person, or an "up-all-night with pizza and vim" type.  Whatever it is, we want to see THAT.

Yes, we also have a more conventional part of our interview process.  You'll talk to us on the phone and in person.  We'll ask you about your current projects, make you answer some tough technical questions, and write code together on a whiteboard.  But the homework is our way of asking you to show us what you're like, on your own terms.

We take our homework pretty seriously, and hope you do, too.  Think carefully about the problems.  Explain what you did (and what you didn't do) using comments and READMEs.  And give us your best code -- polish counts more than features.  Code that's lean, appropriately commented, and thoroughly tested is going to earn high marks, guaranteed.

Our application process is hard.  We know, because every single person in OPOWER's engineering group has been through it.  We do it this way because we want a team full of great people that can produce reliable, real-world solutions.  It may be more work for everybody up front, but we think it's produced great results.  And we think you'll agree when you join us.
