We're still too small of a company to have more than 1 or 2 logical groupings of the development team, and before today they've been basically "the web team" and "everyone else."  Of course, there's a lot of cross-pollination and everything nowadays ultimately manifests itself somehow as "'web".

Still, the "everyone else" paint brush was wearing thin.  In addition to the "web team", we had "the scale team" (a.k.a "Ops R&D") and "the AMI team" and "the core team" and "the report team". . .but most of those were "teams" averaged size 1 and their membership varied from iteration-to-iteration.

Sick of referring to ourselves with a hand-wave and a "you-know. . .the non-web-team," I plugged our names in to an acronym engine and we found the perfect name for ourselves:

**_The Cheated Frogs of Vim_**

While I put in my fair share of vi time in previous development gigs, I'm a little too fond of modern debuggers to go whole-hog with Vim as my "IDE."  Dave, on the other hand, is pretty hard-core with his Vim skills, so our new team name may have some sticking power.

Our wizard graphics guy even cooked up a logo for us:
