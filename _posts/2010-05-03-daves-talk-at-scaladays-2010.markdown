OPOWER graciously sent me to Switzerland this year for ScalaDays 2010.  I was lucky enough to be asked to present on "Sneaking Scala into the Enterprise".  OPOWER sponsored the videography.  My talk, on starting to use Scala in your organization (based on my experience at OPOWER), is linked below; all the talks are online [here](http://days2010.scala-lang.org/node/136).
