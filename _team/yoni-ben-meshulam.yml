bio: |
  Yoni joined Opower in 2008 as a founding member of the web team and in
  2010 became our inaugural Data Scientist. Yoni exhibits an even
  dissatisfaction toward all programming languages and database technologies,
  as he feels any practical polyglot should. Yoni also directs Opower's
  periodic Innovation Days.
