bio: |
  Tom joined Opower in 2008 and dove headfirst into overhauling report
  generation, adding new behavioral science insights, setting up content
  management and even doing a short stint as a Sales Engineer.  Tom likes
  deleting code, sailing, and brewing his own beer, but usually only does one of
  those at a time.
