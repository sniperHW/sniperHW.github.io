bio: |
  Ben has traveled the country coding everything from life insurance software to
  DVD-dispensing robots. After joining Opower in 2012 he began working on many interesting
  problems, including using Elasticsearch to provide insight into utility
  customer data and further automating Opower's report generation pipeline.

  In his free time, Ben likes cycling, computer games, and rock climbing.
